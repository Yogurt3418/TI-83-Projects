# TI-83-Projects
Archive of all my Ti-83 programs from as far back as ~2014

All programs are designed for the Texas Instruments Ti-83+
Most, if not all, should be compatible with similar models (Ti-82, 84, etc.)

ASM can be compiled using https://www.cemetech.net/sc/

ALL of these programs (especially those in z80 asm) should be regarded as unstable unless noted otherwise.  Running these on real hardware may cause crashes, lost variables, and other unwanted side effects.
